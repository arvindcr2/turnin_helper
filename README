Example Usage (lines folled by $ are commands)
------------------------------------------------

See help information:
$ ./turnin_helper --help

Extract sample project(s) to current folder by default:
./turnin_helper -x SAMPLE_PROJ
	Notice the addition of the bboe-1 folder (most recent bboe submission)
	Notice the extract_log file added inside this folder

Extract sample project(s) to "working" directory
./turnin_helper -x SAMPLE_PROJ --work-dir=working
	Must answer yes to the confirmation question

Compile already extracted project(s) in "working" directory
./turnin_helper -m SAMPLE_PROJ --work-dir=working
	Note the addition of the make_log file inside the project folder(s)
	Notice: running student submitted makefiles can be dangerous as they can
	do something like `rm -rf ~` which will delete everything in your
	directory. I recommend not allowing students to make modifications to
	the makefile and providing a known clean makefile via the --makefile
	option.

Clean up (delete) project(s) in "working" directory
./turnin_helper --work-dir=working --purge SAMPLE_PROJ
	Note that this will only delete folders and their contents which
	correspond to the folders created via extraction. If the working folder
	happens to be empty after all the project folders have been deleted then
	a confirmation will appear asking if you'd like to delete the working
	folder.

Extract and run `make clean` on sample project(s) in "working" directory
./turnin_helper -m SAMPLE_PROJ --work-dir=working --target=clean

Proceedure to batch email students their grades
------------------------------------------------
Once a project has been extracted a grade emails can be sent to all the students
in one simple proceedure. There are a couple of features here:

 - In each student's extraction directory a GRADE file can be placed. If exists
   this student wil
